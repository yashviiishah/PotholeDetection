The Commissioner,
Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC),
Municipal Head Office,
Mahapalika Marg, Fort,
Mumbai – 400 001.

**Subject: Formal Complaint Regarding Hazardous Pothole at Latitude: 19.1196, Longitude: 72.846**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally bring to your urgent attention the presence of a significant and hazardous pothole on a critical stretch of road within the BMC's jurisdiction. The precise location of this pothole is identified by the following coordinates:

**Latitude: 19.1196**
**Longitude: 72.846**

This pothole is not merely an inconvenience but poses a serious safety hazard to all road users, including motorists, motorcyclists, and pedestrians. It significantly disrupts the smooth flow of traffic, leading to congestion and delays, particularly during peak hours, thus causing considerable inconvenience to daily commuters. Furthermore, it increases the risk of vehicular damage, flat tires, and, more critically, accidents due to sudden swerving or loss of control, especially during adverse weather conditions or at night.

Given the potential for severe consequences and the daily distress caused to countless citizens, I urge the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to take immediate and decisive action. An expeditious repair of this pothole is absolutely essential to restore road safety and ensure the unimpeded movement of traffic. I request that this matter be treated with the highest priority to prevent any untoward incidents.

I look forward to your prompt response and the swift resolution of this critical issue. Thank you for your attention to this important public safety concern.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Signature]
