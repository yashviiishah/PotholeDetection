Mumbai - 400 001

**Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding a Hazardous Pothole at Latitude: 19.113, Longitude: 72.869**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally report a significant and hazardous pothole that requires immediate attention from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. This pothole is precisely located at the coordinates: **Latitude: 19.113, Longitude: 72.869**.

This particular pothole, situated on a frequently used stretch of road, has become a major source of inconvenience and danger for all commuters. It significantly disrupts the smooth flow of traffic and poses a serious risk to drivers of four-wheelers, motorcyclists, cyclists, and even pedestrians. Road users are often forced to swerve suddenly to avoid it, which can lead to collisions or loss of control, especially during peak hours or adverse weather conditions.

The current state of the road, exacerbated by this pothole, is not only causing potential damage to vehicles but also creating an unsafe environment for the public. Given its location and the continuous movement of traffic, the pothole's condition is likely to worsen, leading to more severe problems if not addressed promptly.

I earnestly request the BMC to take swift and decisive action to inspect this location and initiate the necessary repairs for this pothole at the earliest. Your timely intervention in this matter is crucial for ensuring the safety and convenience of Mumbai's commuting public.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this urgent issue.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Signature]
