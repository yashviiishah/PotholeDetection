**Subject: FORMAL COMPLAINT REGARDING HAZARDOUS POTHOLE AT LATITUDE: 19.2173, LONGITUDE: 73.0936**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally report a significant and hazardous pothole located at the precise coordinates of **Latitude: 19.2173, Longitude: 73.0936**.

This particular pothole appears to be of considerable size and depth, posing a serious safety risk and causing substantial inconvenience to all road users, particularly commuters who frequent this route daily. Drivers are frequently observed having to swerve abruptly to avoid it, leading to unpredictable traffic movements and an increased potential for accidents. Cyclists and motorcyclists are especially vulnerable to serious injury or damage to their vehicles if they encounter it unexpectedly.

The presence of this unrepaired pothole not only damages vehicles but also disrupts the smooth flow of traffic, contributing to delays and frustration for those travelling through the area. It is imperative that this road hazard is addressed promptly.

I urge the Local Authority to investigate this matter without delay and arrange for the necessary repairs to be carried out as soon as possible. Prompt action will ensure the safety and smooth passage of vehicles and pedestrians, mitigating the risks currently posed by this dangerous defect.

I trust that you will treat this complaint with the seriousness it deserves and take swift action to rectify this hazardous situation. I look forward to your prompt attention to this urgent matter.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Name]
