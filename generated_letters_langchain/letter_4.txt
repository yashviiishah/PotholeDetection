This particular pothole poses a considerable threat to the safety of all road users. It causes significant inconvenience to commuters, including drivers of four-wheelers, two-wheeler riders, and pedestrians.

The situation is exacerbated during peak hours and adverse weather conditions, further slowing down traffic and increasing the likelihood of mishaps.

Yours faithfully,
