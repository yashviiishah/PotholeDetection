**Subject: Formal Complaint and Urgent Request for Pothole Repair – Location: Latitude 19.2173, Longitude 73.0936**

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to formally report a significant pothole located at the precise coordinates of Latitude: 19.2173, Longitude: 73.0936, and to request its prompt repair.

This particular pothole appears to be of considerable size and depth, posing a substantial hazard to all road users. It is situated on a regularly used thoroughfare and is causing significant inconvenience to commuters, including drivers, motorcyclists, and cyclists. The defect creates a risk of vehicle damage, punctures, and could potentially lead to accidents, especially during adverse weather conditions or in low light.

The ongoing presence of this pothole disrupts the smooth flow of traffic and adds to the daily frustrations of those using the road. Given the potential safety risks and the daily disruption it causes, I urge the Local Authority to investigate this matter without delay and arrange for its repair as a matter of urgency. Timely intervention will prevent further deterioration of the road surface and mitigate the risks to public safety.

I trust that the Local Authority will give this complaint the serious attention it warrants. I look forward to a prompt response and confirmation of the planned remedial action.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Name]
