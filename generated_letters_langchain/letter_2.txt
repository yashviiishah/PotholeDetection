**Subject: Urgent Complaint Regarding a Dangerous Pothole Requiring Immediate Repair at Latitude: 19.113, Longitude: 72.869**

Respected Sir/Madam,

This letter is to formally bring to your immediate attention the presence of a significant and dangerous pothole located at the precise coordinates of Latitude: 19.113, Longitude: 72.869.

This particular pothole is situated on a frequently used stretch of road and is causing considerable inconvenience and posing a serious risk to all commuters, including motorists, motorcyclists, and pedestrians. Its presence leads to sudden swerving of vehicles, traffic congestion, and a heightened probability of accidents, especially during peak hours and in adverse weather conditions. Furthermore, it contributes to vehicle damage and slows down the overall flow of traffic, impacting daily commutes for a large number of citizens.

Given the substantial risk it presents to public safety and the daily disruption it causes, I earnestly request the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to take prompt and necessary action to repair this pothole without any further delay. Immediate intervention is crucial to prevent potential accidents and ensure the smooth and safe passage of traffic.

I trust that you will treat this matter with the urgency it deserves and initiate the repair work at the earliest.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your prompt action in resolving this critical issue.

Yours faithfully,

[Your Signature]
