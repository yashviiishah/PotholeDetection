Subject: Request for Repair of Pothole at a Busy Intersection

Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to bring to your attention a serious concern regarding a pothole that has been detected at the following location:
Latitude: 19.113,
Longitude: 72.869.

This pothole is located in an area with high footfall and vehicular movement, which causes significant inconvenience to commuters. The rough road surface poses risks of accidents and damage to vehicles. It also affects the smooth flow of traffic, causing unnecessary delays for drivers and pedestrians alike.

I kindly request that your team attends to this issue at the earliest and repairs the pothole as soon as possible. This will help ensure the safety and well-being of our citizens who use this route regularly.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Yours faithfully,
[Your Name]
